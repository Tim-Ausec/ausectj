<p>The course focuses on transmitter and receiver design, with an emphasis on dealing with channel and distortion effects.</p>
<h1 id="2-channel-characteristics">2. Channel Characteristics</h1>
<p>Given a channel of bandwidth B with noise so that the transmitter signal has a signal-to-noise ration of SNR, the channel capacity C (bits/sec = baud rate) is given by:</p>
$$C=Blog_2(1+SNR)$$<p>At low SNR, the improvement in C seems linear, until SNR gets large and return on investment dips.</p>
<h1 id="3-modulation">3. Modulation</h1>
<p>Modulation is the process of translating the message signal into a form that allows efficient transmission over a channel.</p>
<h2 id="31-motivation">3.1 Motivation</h2>
<p>The main purpose of modulating signals is to bring the signal up to a higher frequency band - to understand why this is valuable, consider the length of the antenna required to transmit a signal of frequency $f$. The signal is transmitted as an electromagnetic wave, with wavelength $\lambda$ given by
</p>
$$\lambda=\frac{c}{f}=\frac{3\cdot 10^8}{f}$$<p>.</p>
<p>A fundamental result from studying electromagnetism is that the dipole antenna structure resonates at wavelengths that obey the following relationship, with $L$ being the length of the antenna:
</p>
$$L=n\frac{\lambda}{4}, \forall n = 1,2,3...$$<p>However, most signals that we wish to transmit require huge antennae lengths - for example, the human voice operates just up to about $f=6kHz$ or so. This requires an antenna length of AT LEAST 12.5 km!</p>
<p>Antennae of this size are not only impractical to construct and operate - they also have such high parasitic losses that it would be extremely hard to properly power. Therefore, if we could move the &ldquo;baseband&rdquo; signal up to a higher frequency, we could make practical, efficient antennas. An extra bonus is the ability to separate signals that are transmitted at the same time from one another - we can allocate different frequency bands for different uses, allowing anyone to tune into any given band at any time to receive or transmit on that band&hellip; provided they have permission/licensing.</p>
<h2 id="32-the-modulation-property-of-the-fourier-transform">3.2 The Modulation Property of the Fourier Transform</h2>
<p>Recall from signals and systems:
</p>
$$\mathcal{F}\{x(t)cos(2\pi f_ct)\}=\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{F}\{x(t)(e^{j2\pi f_c t} + e^{-2\pi f_c t})\}=\frac{1}{2}X(f)*(\delta(f+f_c) + \delta(f-f_c))=\frac{1}{2}(X(f+f_c) + X(f-f_c))$$<p>This allows us to modulate signals.</p>
<h2 id="33-sine-waves-as-a-choice-for-modulation">3.3 Sine Waves as a Choice for Modulation</h2>
<p>It is important to examine the prevalence of multiplication by the sine wave for modulation. Indeed, it seems that any high frequency periodic signal could give us a modulated signal (by the fourier series), so why sine waves in particular?</p>
<ol>
<li>Frequency is invariant to linear systems</li>
<li>Generation of sinusoids is easy</li>
<li>Sinusoids take up minimal bandwidth themselves.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="4-going-forward">4 Going Forward</h1>
<p>There are two types of analog modulation that will be discussed in this course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amplitude Modulation</li>
<li>Frequency Modulation</li>
</ul>
