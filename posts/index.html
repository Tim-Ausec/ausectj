		<p>I haven&rsquo;t always wanted my own website. In fact, I was long convinced that creating my own website would be a waste of time and effort.
Anyone can create a Linkedin profile in less than an hour. On the other hand, it might take tens of hours to get your personal website to a point that
employers just might be impressed by.</p>

<p>My first exploration into web development was through an unpaid virtual internship that I took on for a small laundromat in LA after high school.
The laundromat was run by a single guy with dreams of a low-maintanence, passive income stream in the form of this laundromat. He had a few employees,
but was generally hell-bent on reducing costs and raising income with as little effort as possible. The point of the internship was to bring in cheap labor
to help market the business and increase revenues.</p>
