			<h1>How I Made This Website</h1>
			<time datetime="2025-05-31T17:12:33">31.05.2025 17:12</time>
			<div>
				<p>This article documents how I initially made this website.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ol>
<li>Hugo to generate pages</li>
<li>Porkbun for the domain</li>
<li>DigitalOcean for hosting</li>
</ol>
<p>But first, a prelude about the philosophy behind these choices</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="minimalism">Minimalism</h2>
<p>For those who haven’t read the “Why I Made This Website” article, there are three main values that led me to create this website:</p>
<ol>
<li>The value of freedom in the digital world</li>
<li>The value of learning</li>
<li>The value of self-expression</li>
</ol>
<p>But there is a fourth value that has led me towards minimalism as the primary design philosophy for this website:
4. The value of purpose/focus</p>
<p>Minimalism is the embodiment of this value in design. The primary goal of minimalism is focus, and cutting out all distractions except the core is its method.</p>
<p>The core of this website is my self expression - my ideas and interests. Therefore, I won’t bother with ideal formatting, user-friendliness, or dynamic websites - all of these distract from the purpose.</p>
<p>As the cherry on the top, minimal, static websites load quicker, are cheaper, and come with less headache :)</p>
<p>End prelude!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="hugo---static-website-generator">Hugo - Static Website Generator</h2>
<p>I started this process knowing that I wanted a static site, so my main choices were</p>
<ul>
<li>Jekyl</li>
<li>Hugo</li>
<li>placeholder for the one I forgot</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="domain-and-hosting">Domain and Hosting</h2>
<p>This is simple - I just went on Reddit and found a guide that convinced me. My main concern was price and minimizing serious headaches.</p>
<p>Another perk of static websites is that DigitalOcean allows you to host up to 3 for free. Forever(?). So I just have to pay for the domain name!</p>
<p>Porkbun is cheap and seems reputable, so I’m happy there as well.</p>
<p>The only thing I’ve been unhappy with so far is that it took like 2 weeks for digital ocean to propagate as an authorized name server on my domain. I’m not sure if this is a common issue or is just because I’m bumming off of the free hosting, but it worked out so I’m not too worried about it.</p>
