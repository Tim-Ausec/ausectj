				<p>This article keeps track of my go-to dishes.</p>
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>My diet&rsquo;s main functions are to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Support health</li>
<li>Support strength</li>
<li>Enable me to have the body that I want</li>
</ol>
<p>Other careabouts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tasty enough to share with others</li>
<li>Low-cost</li>
<li>Meal-preppable</li>
<li>Supports bodily reslience when diet failure occurs</li>
</ol>
<p>Before we get to the recipies, I want to detail some findings concerning the above points that influence which recipies I include and which I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>
<p>This is a rabbit hole that you could fall down forever in. Just a few points I want to think about:</p>
<h4 id="produce">Produce</h4>
<p>This includes fruits and vegetables. This <a href="https://localfarmmarkets.org/cost_of_fruits.php">website</a> links to some USDA data that analyzes the cost of all sorts of produce. I could dig into the data, but for now I think I&rsquo;ll use the old charts from ~2000 that they have on the front page.</p>
<h4 id="meat">Meat</h4>
<p>For now, I&rsquo;m going with the assumption that meats are generally the most expensive way to get your protein. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m cutting them out (due to the tastiness/sharing factor), but I will try to reduce meat use whenever I can.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="breakfast">Breakfast</h2>
<h3 id="oatmeal">Oatmeal</h3>
<h4 id="baked">Baked</h4>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t tried this yet, but it seems really good. <a href="https://theproteinchef.co/easy-high-protein-baked-oatmeal-recipe/">Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying out this week</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also seen <a href="https://centr.com/recipe/show/14021/recipe">this apple-berry one</a> that I&rsquo;ll probably try out later.</p>
<h4 id="cold">Cold</h4>
<p>The simple 2:1 oatmeal to milk with added cinammon, bananas, strawberries, and honey.</p>
<p>I am trying to move away from this because I often screw up the ratio and the taste just isn&rsquo;t where I want it to be without adding brown sugar.</p>
<h4 id="regular">Regular</h4>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do this much since it isn&rsquo;t very preppable, but <a href="https://loseweightbyeating.com/healthy-protein-oatmeal-recipes/">this seems pretty good</a></p>
<h3 id="egg">Egg</h3>
<hr>
<h2 id="lunchdinner">Lunch/Dinner</h2>
<h3 id="burrito-bowls">Burrito bowls</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.muscleandstrength.com/recipes/high-protein-chicken-burrito-bowl">This burrito bowl</a> is the shit. High protein and yummy, can&rsquo;t ask for much else.</p>
<h3 id="salads">Salads</h3>
<p>Trying <a href="https://centr.com/recipe/show/18645/recipe">this one</a> out - seems kinda fancy and complicated but yummy</p>
<h3 id="mediterranean">Mediterranean</h3>
<p><a href="https://centr.com/recipe/show/17106/recipe">Veggie sheet pan</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<h3 id="protein-powder"><a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/homemade-protein-powder-that-tastes-good-8773905">Protein powder</a></h3>
<p>The idea with this recipie is to avoid additives in store-bought protein powders.</p>
<h3 id="mexican-sides">Mexican Sides</h3>
<p><a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/pico-de-gallo/">Pico de gallo</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/perfect_guacamole/">Guacamole</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="dessertssnacks">Desserts/Snacks</h2>
<p><a href="https://centr.com/recipe/show/13949/recipe">Peanut butter and honey protein squares</a></p>
