      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first exploration into web development was through an unpaid virtual internship that I took on for a small laundromat in LA after high school.&#xA;The laundromat was run by a single guy with dreams of a low-maintanence, passive income stream in the form of this laundromat. He had a few employees,&#xA;but was generally hell-bent on reducing costs and raising income with as little effort as possible. The point of the internship was to bring in cheap labor&#xA;to help market the business and increase revenues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
