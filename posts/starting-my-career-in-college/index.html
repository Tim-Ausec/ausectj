			<h1>Starting My Career in College</h1>

				<p>My first exploration into web development was through an unpaid virtual internship that I took on for a small laundromat in LA after high school.
The laundromat was run by a single guy with dreams of a low-maintanence, passive income stream in the form of this laundromat. He had a few employees,
but was generally hell-bent on reducing costs and raising income with as little effort as possible. The point of the internship was to bring in cheap labor
to help market the business and increase revenues.</p>
<p><strong>It was very open ended,</strong></p>
<p>But the owner had a few ideas on how we could contribute. One of those ideas was SEO optimization
for the laundromat&rsquo;s website, which was created, hosted, and maintained with WordPress. Apparently, a large percentage of new business was gained through Google&rsquo;s tools, particularly
Google maps. Being the only virtual intern, I figured that I should take a swing at it.
So, I watched a lot of videos and took a lot of notes, which turned into configuring a few
things in the options of the WordPress interface. I looked into a few more ways to understand
the site&rsquo;s traffic, but eventually realized that I was putting in a lot of work for no pay,
so I quit the internship and became a bus boy at a mexican restaurant for the rest of the
Summer.</p>
<p>When I got to college in the Fall, I was firehosed with career-related information that my
little blue-collar mind was nearly unable to handle. Networking, career fairs,
interview tips, professionalism, and of course,</p>
<p><strong>the resume.</strong>
The resume is not simply the 2 page list of curated accomplishments and activities that you
hand your potential employer. While this is the most impactful part of your resume, there are
supplemental materials that may help you stand apart from the crowd. The two most
fundamental supplemental materials in my field are the LinkedIn profile and the personal website. By the time that I had completed my resume and started to attain a better idea of
getting jobs in the professional world, I had become influenced by my roommate about the
idea of supplemental materials.</p>
<p><strong>See, my roommate was a CS major.</strong></p>
<p>The thing about CS majors is that they are on a path that sacrifices job security for
potentially lucrative positions. Therefore, they must be well-tuned-in on the job
acquisition process, or <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE">be fed to the wolves</a>. My roommate brought up that it might
be a good idea to make a personal website, as it shows employers that you have technical
muster and are willing to go the extra mile. I was convinced by this idea after being
exposed to a dog-eat-dog mentality for the professional job hunt, and decided to crack open
WordPress. After all, I had experience with it! How hard could it be?</p>
