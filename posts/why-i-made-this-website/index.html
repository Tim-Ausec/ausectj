				<p>I haven&rsquo;t always wanted my own website. In fact, I was long convinced that
creating my own website would be a waste of time and effort. This article
documents the reasons why I took the jump.</p>
<h3 id="1-control-over-my-digital-presence">1. Control Over My Digital Presence</h3>
<p>The most appealing argument against creating your own website is that simpler,
snazzier tools exist that serve the same functionality as a website.</p>
<p><strong>The issue is, these tools are social media platforms.</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of issues with using a social media platform in general.
The one that I want to focus on is the lack of control that you have as a
user. This takes many forms:</p>
<ol>
<li>How your posts are used or shared.</li>
<li>How your data is used and shared.</li>
<li>What content is shared with you.</li>
<li>What form your creative expression can take.</li>
<li>What you are allowed to say.</li>
<li>How you can interact and engage with others.</li>
<li>Who can see your posts (needing to be signed in to have access).</li>
</ol>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Each of these points deserve their own paragraph, but I&rsquo;ll spare the details
(for now). The point is that the social media experience fundamentally
restricts how you exist on the internet. It also extracts your work and
attention for profit through advertising and AI training.</p>
