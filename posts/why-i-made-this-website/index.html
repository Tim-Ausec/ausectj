			<h1>Why I Made This Website</h1>

				<p>I haven&rsquo;t always wanted my own website. In fact, I was long convinced that
creating my own website would be a waste of time and effort. This article
documents the reasons why I took the jump.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<ol>
<li>I desire control over my digital presence.</li>
<li>I want to learn about web development (AKA I like to make my life harder than
necessary).</li>
<li>I want to express myself.</li>
</ol>
<p>But first, a prelude as to why I care about any of this digital stuff anyways:</p>

<h2 id="the-internets-potential">The Internet&rsquo;s Potential</h2>
<p>/********************************************************</p>
<p><strong>I cannot help but stand in awe of great machines.</strong></p>
<p>********************************************************/</p>
<p>Regardless of their consequences or aesthetics, great machines move me in a
way that little else does.</p>
<p>Whether they advance altruistic ideals or grind humanity out of the flesh,
whether their branding is appealing or repulsive, whether built upon the
passionate sweat of enthusiasts for the love of the craft or upon slave labor,
whether they are used for &ldquo;good&rdquo; or for &ldquo;evil,&rdquo; I am drawn to these machines.</p>
<p>Part of this draw comes from my relationship with creation. Creating trinkets and
realizing ideas is a major component of my sense of purpose. So, when I gaze
upon the fruits of the effort and ingenuity that go into the
creation of these machines, I clearly see the exact portion of creation that
is in my hands -</p>
<p><strong>approximately 0.</strong></p>
<p>The realization that the whole of the fruits
from my central passion of creation amounts to nothing in the grand
scheme of things ultimately drives me to better understand these systems and
their creators in order to, one day, have a meaningful portion of creation
in my hands, even in a subjective sense.</p>
<p>Among the most personally impactful great machines stand:</p>
<ul>
<li>the electrical grid</li>
<li>the global supply chain
and of course,</li>
<li>the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet, even among the greats the internet stands out as a
different form of machine entirely. Where the grid is made of wood and steel,
and global supply chains made of organized human efforts, the internet is an
semi-organized amalgamation of silicon, intelligence, and emotion.</p>
<p>The systems of the internet and the masses that interact with them are nearly
indistinguishable - discourse and consumption meld with algorithms and
capital to create utterly new experience and forms of organization.</p>
<p><strong>Interacting with this system is an utterly unique human experience.
There is no comparison.</strong></p>
<p>However, this does not mean the system is necessarily <em>good</em> for humanity. There is much
to be said about problems that stem from the existence of the internet.
However, I think that we are very lucky in the opposite
regard - the origins of the internet have
strong roots in a few incredible ideas which have the potential for massive upside.</p>
<p>The central idea that can help us understand the internet&rsquo;s potential is
freedom. The internet and digital tools offer immense freedom in the domains
of communication and creation. This freedom goes both ways - there is power
to take away freedom for others and to create freedom for yourself.
Alongside this freedom are the ideas upon which the early internet and digital age stand.</p>
<p><strong>The freedom offered by the internet can either serve to undermine these ideas,
or to strengthen them.</strong></p>
<p>However, there is an inherent contradiction in the freedom of the internet
that must be addressed. In order to create freedom with the internet,
one must have access to tools and interfaces that are not inherently abundant.
Thus, access to freedom is restricted by the means by which freedom is created,
creating a contradiction.</p>
<p>For example,
one must have the basic technology needed to access the internet in the first
place. Then, to create freedom in the form of a web app, one must have access
to tools (either through development or purchasing) that allow them to create
their web app.</p>
<p><strong>At each step of freedom on the internet comes the need for a
scarce tool.</strong></p>
<p>This is the inherent contradiction in the freedom that the internet grants its
users. This contradiction arises from the real-world restrictions on how
we can use these tools.</p>
<p>This is where the originating ideas of the internet come in. These ideas help
us understand how to deal with this contradiction in order to recover the
greatest freedom within the situation we are in. Fortuntaley for us,
these ideas are inherently built into the function of digital devices.</p>
<p><strong>The nature of digital devices are the open and free sharing of information
and tools.</strong></p>
<p>This is what FLOSS (Free Libre Open Source Software) is all about - software that is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Free: think free speech, not free beer</li>
<li>Libre: licensed so that anyone can replicate and edit the software</li>
<li>Open Source: the source code is available for everyone to see</li>
</ol>
<p>FLOSSs (nice acronym, huh?) are key tools that maximize freedom for users of
digital tools. Understanding why this is true is an essential keystone
for understanding the importance of this website in my digital existence.</p>
<p>/********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p><strong>The whole point of bothering with the internet is the freedom it offers -
the sacrifice of this freedom in exchange for convenience through
neglect of the FLOSS principles must be rejected.</strong></p>
<p>********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************/</p>
<p>End prelude!</p>

<h2 id="social-media-is-inadequate-and-harmful">Social Media is Inadequate and Harmful</h2>
<p>The most appealing argument against creating your own website is that simpler,
snazzier tools exist that serve the same functionality as a website.</p>
<p>/***************************************************************</p>
<p><strong>The issue is that these tools are social media platforms.</strong></p>
<p>***************************************************************/</p>
<p>There are a number of issues with using social media platforms in general.
The one that I want to focus on is the lack of control that you have as a
user. This takes many forms:</p>
<ol>
<li>How your posts are used or shared.</li>
<li>How your data is used and shared.</li>
<li>What content is shared with you.</li>
<li>What form your creative expression can take.</li>
<li>What you are allowed to say.</li>
<li>How you can interact and engage with others.</li>
<li>Who can see your posts.</li>
</ol>
<p>&hellip; etc</p>
<p>Each of these points deserve their own paragraph, but I&rsquo;ll spare the details
(for now). The point is that the social media experience fundamentally
restricts how you exist on the internet. It also extracts your work and
attention for profit through advertising and AI training.</p>
<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t want that, so I won&rsquo;t use these tools.</strong></p>
<h2 id="a-word-on-learning-and-difficulty---or---gee-whizz-whats-this-web-dev-thing-about">A Word on Learning and Difficulty - or - Gee Whizz, What&rsquo;s This Web Dev Thing About?</h2>
<p>Learning is a key aspect of my identity and purpose. I find the process of
interpretation and fitting disconnected nuggets of information into a larger
picture one of the most satisfying activities one can possibly engage in.</p>
<p>/*******************************************************</p>
<p><strong>That is to say, learning is intrinsically valuable.</strong></p>
<p>*******************************************************/</p>
<p>I believe everyone can relate to this on some level. I honestly find learning too
gratifying to believe that learning is not a universal good. However, I find
myself mired in anti-intellectual sentiment nearly everywhere I go - even in
academia. This is a contradiction, no? Well, I would say that the break in appetite b
etween myself and others comes from the difficulty involved in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Learning is also an instrinsically painful and difficult process.</strong></p>
<p>Learning involves not only the creation of new bonds in the mind, but also the
destruction of old bonds. It requires a taste for not only finding out where
you&rsquo;re right, but where you&rsquo;re wrong as well. In fact, most learning takes place
through the process of painfully ripping out the foundation of your knowledge
and starting from scratch, seeing how it compares to what was there before,
what others have, and then doing it all over again.</p>
<p>Learning is never <em>done.</em> You never accomplish <em>learning.</em> However, the process
is absolutely <em>wonderful.</em></p>
<p>This is why I am taking a pains to learn web development - not only because
I am arrogant enough to believe that creating a website will be easy peasy and
worth the time investment in order to have adequate control over my digital presence,
but also because</p>
<p><strong>it&rsquo;s worth it.</strong></p>
<h2 id="self-expression-through-the-internet">Self-Expression Through the Internet</h2>
<p>As I grow older, I realize that I have never given self-expression nearly enough
credit. I have always been drawn to systems and machines - to the study of
the external, the objective. However, through my study of the objective I have
come to appreciate the subjective more and more for a simple reason.</p>
<p>/***********************************************************</p>
<p><strong>The subjective is more interesting, but only on a personal level.</strong></p>
<p>***********************************************************/</p>
<p>This is interesting because the objective is interesting to many people for the
fact that the objective is inherent in the object itself.
The subjective, on the other hand, is interesting insofar as it relates to the
observer. That is, my &ldquo;self,&rdquo; in its purest form, is something that
can only be interesting to me; however, once I translate aspects of my &ldquo;self&rdquo; into
forms of self-expression, it instantly becomes interesting to everyone for
the fact that they exist and are witnessing my self-expression.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll admit - I still haven&rsquo;t got it all worked out. But, I know that I ought to
value my self-expression more, and that I have to share it. Therefore, I will
leverage the freedom of the internet to express myself and share that expression
with others.</p>
