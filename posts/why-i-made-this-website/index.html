			<h1>Why I Made This Website</h1>
			<time datetime="2025-05-31T17:20:26">31.05.2025 17:20</time>

				<p>I haven&rsquo;t always wanted my own website. In fact, I was long convinced that
creating my own website would be a waste of time and effort. This article
documents the reasons why I took the jump.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<ol>
<li>I desire control over my digital presence.</li>
<li>I want to learn about web development&hellip; (I like to make my life harder than
necessary).</li>
<li>I want to express myself.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>My reasons for creating this website can be separated into two buckets:
the inherent desires and ideas that creating a website fulfills, and
why other tools are not adequate to fulfill these ideas and desires. I will
start with the latter and end with brief thoughts on the former.</p>
<h3 id="the-internets-potential">The Internet&rsquo;s Potential</h3>
<p><strong>I cannot help but stand in awe of great machines.</strong></p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Whether they advance altruistic ideals or grind humanity out of the flesh,
whether I feel great affinity toward them or utter disgust, the volumes of
effort, ingenuity, and/or elegance that summon great machines into existence
make my whole existence but a single drop in a storm. So I must stand in awe.</p>
<p>Among the greats stand the electrical grid, the global supply chain, and of
course, the internet. Yet, even among the greats the internet stands out as a
different form of machine entirely. Where the grid is made of wood and steel,
and global supply chains made of organized human efforts, the internet is an
unorganized amalgamation of silicon, intelligence, and emotion.</p>
<p>The systems of the internet and the masses that interact with them are nearly
indistinguishable - discourse and consumption meld with algorithms and
capital to create utterly new experience and organization. The heaping mass
called the internet is the principal example of cybernetics in the modern day.</p>
<p><strong>Interacting with this system is an utterly unique human experience.
There is no comparison.</strong></p>
<p>However, this does not mean the system is a <em>good</em> for humanity. There is much
to be said about problems only possible with the existence of the internet.
However, I think that we are very lucky in this regard. The particular form
that this amalgamation of technology and humanity took has tremendously
strong roots in a few ideas which I believe are an ultimate good for humans.</p>
<p><strong>The nature of the beast can serve to undermine these ideas. But
only if you let it.</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t meaningfully exist in the digital world without using
tools. The nature of the beast is that complex interfaces must be created and
maintained in order to exist in a coherent sense on the web.
However, you can choose which tools to use!</p>
<p><strong>The internet&rsquo;s nature and origin is the open and free sharing of information
and tools.</strong></p>
<p>This is what FLOSS is all about - software that is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Free (think free speech, not free beer)</li>
<li>Libre (licensed so that anyone can replicate and edit the software)</li>
<li>Open Source (the source code is available for everyone to see)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is an essential</p>
<h3 id="social-media-is-inadequate-and-harmful">Social Media is Inadequate and Harmful</h3>
<p>The most appealing argument against creating your own website is that simpler,
snazzier tools exist that serve the same functionality as a website.</p>
<p><strong>The issue is that these tools are social media platforms.</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of issues with using a social media platform in general.
The one that I want to focus on is the lack of control that you have as a
user. This takes many forms:</p>
<ol>
<li>How your posts are used or shared.</li>
<li>How your data is used and shared.</li>
<li>What content is shared with you.</li>
<li>What form your creative expression can take.</li>
<li>What you are allowed to say.</li>
<li>How you can interact and engage with others.</li>
<li>Who can see your posts.</li>
</ol>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Each of these points deserve their own paragraph, but I&rsquo;ll spare the details
(for now). The point is that the social media experience fundamentally
restricts how you exist on the internet. It also extracts your work and
attention for profit through advertising and AI training.</p>
<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t want that, so I won&rsquo;t use these tools.</strong></p>
