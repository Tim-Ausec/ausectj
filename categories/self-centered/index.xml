      <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t always wanted my own website. In fact, I was long convinced that creating my own website would be a waste of time and effort.&#xA;Anyone can create a Linkedin profile in less than an hour.

The point of the internship was to bring in cheap labor&#xA;to help market the business and increase revenues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
